# PowerShell
My roaming PowerShell setup

This repository represents a snapshot of my development machine's PowerShell configuration.  Any modules, scripts, themes, documents or installers for PowerShell utilities are stored here.  This way no matter where I need posh, I can be running just the way I like in just a few minutes.
