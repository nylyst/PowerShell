    The System module adds the following functions to your session when you import
    the module.

        Get-BootStatus                Gets information about how the system was started, e.g. Safe Mode
        Get-DisplaySetting            Gets the width and height of the primary monitor.
        Get-LogicalDiskInventory      Gets the logical disks on the local and remote computers.

        Get-Processor                 Gets processor information for local and remote computers.
        Get-WindowsEdition            Gets the operating system edition.
        Test-32Bit                    Returns TRUE when the computer has a 32-bit processor architecture.
        Test-64Bit                    Returns TRUE when the computer has a 64-bit processor architecture.
