    The PSUserTools module adds the following functions to your session when you import
    the module.

        Get-Everyone                   Gets information about all local accounts on the computer.
        Start-ProcessAsAdministrator   Starts a process with Administrator permssions 
                                       ("Run as administrator").

        Test-IsAdministrator           Returns TRUE when the current user is an administrator.

    For information about these functions, use the Get-Help cmdlet. For example,
    to get detailed help for the Get-Feed function, type "get-help get-everyone -detailed."

    These functions are implemented in the module as scripts, but are available in the session
    as functions.
