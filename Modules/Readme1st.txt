============
INSTALLATION
============

To install the Powershell Pack, copy PowerShellPack.zip to your Windows 7 
computer and extract the compressed files to a destination folder on your 
computer. Then double-click on the InstallPowerShellPack.cmd batch file from 
within the destination folder. 

After you run this, the modules in the PowerShell Pack will be copied to the 
modules directory of the current user. Anywhere you copy the PowerShell Pack 
to will contain the installation, and running the InstallPowerShellPack.cmd from 
that directory will copy the PowerShell Pack to the current user's directory.


=====================
USING POWERSHELL PACK
=====================

To run the PowerShell Pack, use Import-Module PowerShellPack.  

To import individual modules, use Import-Module ModuleName (i.e. Import-Module WPK).

To get help on individual commands, use Get-Help CommandName, for instance, 
Get-Help Get-Image. 

For tips on getting started using the PowerShell Pack, see the following two 
documents which are included in the PowerShell Pack:

- About the Windows 7 Resource Kit PowerShell Pack.docx

- Quick Start to Writing User Interfaces with WPK.docx


=============
COMMON ERRORS
=============

If you have not changed your execution policy, you may get an error like this:

...cannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system. 
Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.

In this case, you should consider changing your execution policy to RemoteSigned, 
Unrestricted, or Bypass.  These execution policies are there for your protection, 
to help ensure that scripts you do not trust are not run by default.

If you attempt to use WPK within the PowerShell Console, you may see this error:

New-Object : Exception calling ".ctor" with "0" argument(s): "The calling thread 
must be STA, because many UI components require this."

This error is exactly what it says. The PowerShell Console runs in MTA mode by 
default, which WPF will not allow. The PowerShell Integrated Scripted Environment 
on the other hand runs in STA mode, so you can run scripts within the Integrated 
Scripting Environment, or you can run the PowerShell Console with the -sta switch. 


==============
UNINSTALLATION
==============

To uninstall the PowerShell Pack, simply delete the individual module directories.
