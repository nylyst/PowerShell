# this file defines the UI elements that should be visible for a given scenario.

# You can create as many of these configuration files as you need.
# For example, create a "beginners" level UI, or a specialized UI appearance 
# with only a subset of available features.

# To be accessible to ISESteroids, place this file in the "Level" subfolder inside
# of the ISESteroids program folder.

# All files that you place there will appear in the menu "Level". 
# The menu picks up the file name, so be sure to apply a meaningful name to your 
# configuration files.

# In the menu "Level", you can choose which file you would like to apply.
