Add closing curly brace
Your code has an open curly brace, but no matching closing curly brace.
Either remove the opening curly brace, or add a closing brace.

Curly braces are used to "transport" PowerShell code to someone.
You can hand over PowerShell code to a command, for example.
Or you can assign code to a function, or an If clause.

In all of these cases, the code is enclosed in braces. Braces make sure the code is not executed.
Instead, the receiver of your code decides when and how often the code executes.

Code enclosed in curly braces is called a "scriptblock".
