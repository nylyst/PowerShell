Add closing quote
Quotes enclose text. You are missing the closing quote.

Take a look at the <bold>start</bold> of the squiggle line. This is where your text starts. Then place the closing quote where you want the text to end.

Or, remove the quote at the beginning of the squiggle line if it was just an accident.

Note that text can span multiple lines. If you want a quote to appear inside your text, make sure you escape the quote. Else, PowerShell may be confused and treat the quote as end-of-text.
