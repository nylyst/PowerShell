Stick to legal #requires options
A #requires statement dicatates which requirements must be met before a script can run. #requires can contain <bold>one or more of the following parameters</bold>:

-RunAsAdministrator
-Version 2
-Modules ActiveDirectory, PrintManagement
-PSSnapin VMWare
-ShellID PowerShell_ISE

There are no other supported parameters, and specifying a non-supported parameter raises a syntax error.

You can have multiple #requires statements in your scirpt. However, each option can only be defined once in your script.

Note that #requires will be enforced only in scripts. "Untitled" documents are no scripts, and #requires statements do nothing.
