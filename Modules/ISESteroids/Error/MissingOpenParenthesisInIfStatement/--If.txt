Add a condition and a scriptblock.
An If statement needs two things: a <bold>condition</bold>, and a <bold>scriptblock</bold>.
The condition determines when the scriptblock should execute. It is enclosed in parenthesis.
A scriptblock is enclosed in braces and contains the script code to execute when the condition evaluates to $true.

An If statement looks like this:

If ($value -eq 123) 
{
  'Executing when $value contains the value 123'
}
