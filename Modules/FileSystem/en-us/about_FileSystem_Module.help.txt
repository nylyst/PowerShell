SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the FileSystem module in the Windows 7 Resource Kit.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The FileSystem module contains functions that work on the file system
    drives in Windows PowerShell. 

    The following functions are added to your session when you import
    the FileSystem module

        Copy-ToZip             Compresses files and adds them to a ZIP file. 
        Get-DuplicateFile      Finds files that have identical file contents.  
        Get-FreeDiskSpace      Gets the free disk space on logical drives
                               of the local computer or a remote computer.

        Get-SHA1               Computes the SHA1 hash of the specified file.
        Mount-SpecialFolder    Creates PSDrives for special folders in the system.
        New-Zip                Creates a new zip archive.
        Rename-Drive           Renames a file system drive.

    For information about these functions, use the Get-Help cmdlet. For example,
    to get detailed help for the Copy-ToZip function, type "get-help copy-tozip -detailed."


    NOTE: The Mount-SpecialFolder is run automatically in your session when 
          you import the FileSystem module. As a result, the session includes
          a Windows PowerShell drive (PSDrive) for each special folder in the
          system.

    These functions are implemented as scripts, but are available in the 
    session as functions.
