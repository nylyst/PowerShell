    .SYNOPSIS
        Import Windows Credentials from a SecureString based CliXML file
    .DESCRIPTION
        Import Windows Credentials from a SecureString based CliXML file

        This is 'pipe-able' via the '$Path' PropertyName if need to decode multiple secure credential 
        files and pass those done the pipeline.

        Note: SecureString encryption, without passing in a key value, would be using a 'key' from the 
        current user (you!) to encrypt these strings and thus anyone that can log as you (co-worker,
        wife, hacker, ...) could use these saved Credentials...
        
        Note: This function accepts using a SecureString as a Key for the encryption. Review the SecureString 
        help to determine usage. It is your respondibility to protext that Key (Please do not enter and save it 
        your script(!!!) as you might as well used Clear Text to begin with)

        Note: ConfirmImpact = High? Yes, you are saving a user's credentials to a file. Even though 
        this is using Secure Strings in PowerShell you still need to be aware that is can be a 
        security risk and that a file with credentials will now exist.

        Note: If are working in a 'secure' computing environment, I would highly recommend you not use 
        these functions, a RSA SSL cert based encryption and decryption based system would be the correct
        way to deliver functions like these. In case of suspect access, you can revoke the SSL cert and those
        saved cred would be null and void to the hacker.
    .EXAMPLE
        c:\PS>$orgCred = Get-Credential; $orgCred |Export-Credential -Path 'DeleteMe.clixml' -Confirm:$false; 
        c:\PS>$newCred = Import-Credential -Path 'DeleteMe.clixml' ; rm DeleteMe.clixml ; Compare-Object $orgCred $newCred -IncludeEqual

    .SYNOPSIS
        Export Windows Credentials to a SecureString based CliXML file
    .DESCRIPTION
        This routine saves PSCredentials into a securestring based CliXML file for later 
        retrieval (Import-Credential). 

        Most uses of the Import/Export-Credential involve automating scripts that require 
        evalavated permissions or scripts that need to be schedule but require different credentials
        than one from the scheduler's credentials.

        Note: SecureString encryption, without passing in a key value, would be using a 'key' from the 
        current user (you!) to encrypt these strings and thus anyone that can log as you (co-worker,
        wife, hacker, ...) could use these saved Credentials...
        
        Note: This function accepts using a SecureString as a Key for the encryption. Review the SecureString 
        help to determine usage. It is your respondibility to protext that Key (Please do not enter and save it
