    .SYNOPSIS
        Stop and Set the Windows Search Indexer to disabled
    .DESCRIPTION
        Call me lazy, I get tried of typing the cmds to stop and disable the 
        WSearch Service on the Windows 8 machines I touch.... I use them as jumpboxes 
        to AWS, Azure, VPN based datacenters and the pauses during the indexing of scripts, transcripts, 
        drives me insane...
